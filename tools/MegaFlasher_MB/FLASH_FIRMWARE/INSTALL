Building stm32flash

A set of static makefiles is provided that should work on most operating
systems with a standard build environment, for instance GNU make and gcc.

1. Build executable

	make

2. Install executable and manual page (optional)

	make install

   The install location base can be set with the PREFIX flag (default
   is /usr/local), e.g. make install PREFIX=/opt
