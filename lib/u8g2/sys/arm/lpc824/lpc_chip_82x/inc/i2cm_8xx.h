/** @defgroup I2CM_8XX CHIP: LPC8XX I2C master-only driver
 * @ingroup I2C_8XX
 * This driver only works in master mode. To describe the I2C transactions
 * following symbols are used in driver documentation.
 *
 * Key to symbols
 * ==============
 * S     (1 bit) : Start bit
 * P     (1 bit) : Stop bit
 * Rd/Wr (1 bit) : Read/Write bit. Rd equals 1, Wr equals 0.
 * A, NA (1 bit) : Acknowledge and Not-Acknowledge bit.
 * Addr  (7 bits): I2C 7 bit address. Note that this can be expanded as usual to
 *                 get a 10 bit I2C address.
 * Data  (8 bits): A plain data byte. Sometimes, I write DataLow, DataHigh
 *                 for 16 bit data.
 * [..]: Data sent by I2C device, as opposed to data sent by the host adapter.
