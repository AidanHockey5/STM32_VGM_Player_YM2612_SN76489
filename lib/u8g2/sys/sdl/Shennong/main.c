The Farmer God Shen Nong Tastes All the Plants 

http://chinesereadingpractice.com/2012/08/22/the-farmer-god-shen-nong-tastes-all-the-plants/



All his life, Shen Nong had a crystal abdomen, and one could 
clearly see all of his internal organs. At that time, humans were 
often getting sick and even dying because they ate things 
indiscriminately [not knowing if they were good or bad]. Shen 
Nong determinedly tasted everything everywhere; the 
good-tasting things he put in a bag on his left side, those were 
for people to eat; the bad-tasting things he put in a bag on his 
right side, and those were used for medicine.

The first time, Shen Nong tasted a small fresh leaf. As this leaf 
fell into his stomach, it cleaned every inch of his insides so that 
every organ top and bottom was fresh and cool, as if [the leaf] 
was somehow on patrol [making the rounds], so Shen Nong 
called it “chá” [to investigate / check], and later generations of 
men called it “chá” [tea]. Shen Nong put it in the bag on the 
right. The second time, Shen Nong tasted a little light red flower 
that looked like a butterfly, which was sweet and delicious, with 
an exotic smell that filled his nostrils, so he called it “licorice”. He 
put it in the bag on the left. In this way, Shen Nong diligently 
tasted all manner of flora, and every time he was poisoned, he 
used tea to rescue himself. Before long, the bag on his left 
contained 47,000 kinds of flowers, grasses, roots and leaves, 
and the right side had 398,000 kinds.

But one day, Shen Nong tasted “heartbreak grass”, and this 
poison was too terrible, so there wasn’t enough time to eat the 
tea leaves to detoxify and he died. He sacrificed himself to save 
humanity, so people call him the “Bodhisattva of Medicine”, and 
people forever commemorate him through this story.
