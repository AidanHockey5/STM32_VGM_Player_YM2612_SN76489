I've tried to keep as many components on Digikey as possible, but obviously, not everything will be on there.
That means that if you'd like a complete order of components, you must have all of the components from the DIGIKEY-BOM.csv file AND the EXTERNAL_BOM_ITEMS.txt list.

For items like resistors: Bog-standard 1/4 watt (the most common sizes you'd normally find in kits) will work, but I tried to track some down on Digikey any ways. 

For items listed on Aliexpress: Shop around and do your research. The links I provided should give you a great head start. Also check sources like eBay for similar goods.
LCSC can also provide parts at a significantly lower price than Digikey, but their selection is not as good. If you order a PCB from JLCPCB, you can ship components from LCSC combined for free.

You can use the Digikey BOM import tool to make this entire process much faster: https://www.digikey.com/BOM
